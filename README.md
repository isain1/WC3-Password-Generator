# WC3-Password-Generator

The purpose of this is to create a random password for a user. When the generator is initialized, the user is prompted to choose a specific length in between 8 to 128 characters and then asks the user whether or not they would like to include lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, or special characters. The generator then takes the users preferances and creates a random password that satiusfiesa the conditions.
